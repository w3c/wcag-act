# How to contribute

## Provide Feedback
The [ACT Taskforce](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/) welcomes the feedback in two ways:

1. *Pull requests:* Submit a pull request if you have a change that you wish to propose to the work. Pull requests are best used if you have a very specific change in mind. When ready for review, label your pull request *Ready for Survey*. Or, review and comment on existing pull requests to provide feedback to the author.
2. *Issues:* Submit an issue if you feel there is a problem with some of the existing work which you wish to discuss. Issues are best used if you do not have a change in mind.

### Submit An Issue

Before submitting an issue, we ask that you look through existing issues to ensure that there isn't already an issue that addresses this topic, either open or closed. You can find a list of all issues at: [w3c/wcag-act Issues tab](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act/issues).

For help creating an issue, see [GitHub Help, creating an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

### Submit A Pull Request

A pull request is a request to pull changes that have been made in one place, and merge them into another. Contributors each maintain a local copy, a fork, of the project (the repository). Changes made to it can be sent in as a pull request to the main project.

Pull requests will be reviewed by the ACT Taskforce, after which, one of three things may happen:

1. If everything is alright, the pull request will be merged and closed.
2. If additional changes are needed, a comment outlining the necessary changes will be added to the pull request. The *author of the pull request* should make the requested changes. This may lead to further discussion and more change requests. We try to keep this as short as possible.
3. If the group feels the pull request is not in line with existing work, the pull request may be declined. A comment will be left outlining the reason for the decline.

### Submit A Proposal

If you have a change in mind that you wish to propose, you can do so by creating a pull request. The easiest way to do this is by navigating to the [wcag-act repository](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act), find the file you wish to edit, and follow the GitHub Help instructions on [Editing files in another repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).
