Introduction {#intro}
=====================

There are currently many products available which aid their users in testing for conformance of accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0. As the web develops and grows in both size and complexity, these tools are essential for managing the accessibility of resources available on the web. The volume of information and services organizations provide on the web make it often impractical to manually test for accessibility.

Accessibility experts often disagree on how accessibility requirements should be tested. These disagreements on how a requirement should be tested, lead to conflicting results of accessibility tests. This is true for both manual accessibility tests as well as for accessibility testing done through automated test tools (ATTs).

Describing how to test certain accessibility requirements is the answer to this. By describing the test procedures, the results of an accessibility test become reproducible, and the test method becomes transparent. The Accessibility Conformance Testing Framework (ACT Framework) defines the requirements of these test descriptions, known as Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules (ACT Rules).

Scope {#scope}
==============

The ACT Framework is created to develop rules for the conformance of web technologies, including those used in digital publishing. This includes technologies such as HTML, CSS, WAI-ARIA, SVG and more. The ACT Framework is designed to be technology agnostic, meaning it has no specific technology in mind. This also means that the ACT Framework could conceivably be used for other technologies. Whether or not this is the case depends on the specific technology.

Accessibility requirements such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which is specifically designed for web content, can be tested using ACT Rules. Other accessibility requirements that would also be applicable to web technologies should also be testable with ACT Rules. Because some of those accessibility requirements may be applicable to technologies other than web technologies, the ACT Framework may not be suitable for every part of this requirement.

For example, the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 is applicable to web-based user agents, for which ACT Rules could be developed, but other technologies can also be used to develop User Agents, which are not web-based.

ACT Rule Structure {#structure}
==============================

Rule Outline {#structure-outline}
-----------------------

A rule MUST provide the following items written in plain language:

* A descriptive title
* A unique identifier
* A rule description
* Accessibility requirement(s)
* Related techniques
* Assumptions, if any
* Test procedure

Rule Description {#structure-description}
----------------------------------------

Each ACT Rule MUST have a description that:

* Is in plain language and provides a brief explanation of what the rule does.
* Explains the accessibility requirement being tested such as the WCAG Success Criterion.
* Refers to any related information, such as the WCAG Techniques it maps to; For example WCAG 2.0, Technique H67.

Accessibility Requirements {#structure-accessibility-requirements}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the accessibility requirement being tested such as the WCAG SC and / or the technique the rule maps to; For example WCAG 2.0 Technique H67.

Limitations, Assumptions or Exceptions {#structure-limitations-assumptions-exceptions}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

List any limitations, assumptions or any exceptions for the test, the test environment, technologies being used or the subject being tested; For example: A rule for 1.4.1: Use of Color has to make an assumption with CSS-properties are used to make a link visually evident. Typically something like background, border, color, font, or text-decoration.

Accessibility Support {#structure-acc-supp}
---------------------------------------

<p class="note">Editor's Note - The ACT Taskforce acknowledges that this approach does not capture all nuances of accessibility support. We are looking for feedback on how to balance the need for organizations to solve issues with buggy or unsupported features in assistive technologies, with keeping the development cycle lean, and delivering future-proof products.</p>

Determining if a web page is accessible, depends partly on the assistive technologies that are used to access it. This is known as [Accessibility Supported in WCAG 2.0][accsupp]. When testing a web page for accessibility, it is important to know which assistive technologies are to be used for this page.

Because of this it is important that users of ACT Rules can determine which accessibility features are relied upon in a rule. With this information, user can determine which rules do not provide results that are in line with the accessibility support baseline set for this particular test.

Developers of Accessibility Test Tools should use this information to develop a default ruleset that is sensible for their user base. Additionally, they could allow users of ATT to customize which rules are run, allowing fine grained control of the accessibility test.

A list of `Relied upon accessibility features` is an optional part of ACT Rule. Not every accessibility requirement involves assistive technologies, and so certain rules will have no use for this feature. For HTML, XML and similar markup documents, the accessibility features should be described using a three part CSS selector.

- Context: The context in which the element for which support is checked lives. If there is no specific context, this can be left blank.
- Element: The name of the element that is being tested. If the element name is irrelevant, use `*`.
- Attributes: Specific attributes that are to be tested. If there are none, this can be left blank.

Example 1: Requires support for the `alt` attribute on an `img` element, existing within a link.

```
  a[ref] img[alt]
```

Example 2: Requires support for role=menuitem on any type of element, existing within an element marked up as a menu

```
  *[role=menu] *[role=menuitem]
```

ACT Input Data {#input}
=======================

Test Subjects {#input-test-subject}
-------------------------------

Web pages, including publications and applications go through many different stages before it is rendered to the end user. For example, PHP may be used to put various pieces of content into a template. That template is then sent as an HTML text document to a web browser, which in term parses it and turns it into a DOM tree, before rendering it to the screen. At each of these stages, accessibility tests could be run. It is therefore important to specify the *test subject type* that an ACT Rule expects.

The following test subject types are common in accessibility testing:

- HTTP Response
- DOM Tree
- Rendered Page
- Template
- Script

Other types of test subjects may be possible. In those cases the ACT Rule *must* include a detailed description of the test subject type, or a reference to the that description.

### HTTP Response Testing

Testing the files as they are served to the web browser (or other user agent) has its limitations. The files may be manipulated in different ways through presentation and scripting. Although this is an excellent place for parser testing.

### DOM Tree Testing

After the web browser (or other user agent) has parsed the files, and executed scripts to get it into a specific state (be it the initial state or any other), tests can be run against the DOM Tree. The DOM Tree can be tested for things like correct parent-child relationships, use of required attributes or properties and more.

### Rendered Page Testing

Testing the browser is the next level up from DOM Tree Testing. In addition to building the DOM Tree, the browser styles elements in the DOM tree and positions them. This enables a rule to determine if an element is visible, which is critical for many tests. Additionally, testing things like the color contrast becomes possible at this level.

### Template Testing

A template is document that has 'open' fields that are filled with pieces of content or other templates. E.g. an HTML template contains a head with a variable title, a predefined navigation, and a variable content area.

Example: `<img>` tags with a variable `src`, *must not* have a static `alt` value.

### Script Testing

A composition is a class or component that extends other native elements or other compositions, to build a higher level component. E.g. a login form component, consists of a form, a few fields, and a label.

Example: Component properties starting with `aria-` *must* exist in the list of WAI-ARIA attributes.


ACT Test Procedure {#test-proc}
===============================

Selector {#test-proc-selector}
--------

A selector is a pattern that is used as a condition to filter input data to be evaluated against the test procedure. For example, finding all  nodes in the DOM tree, or finding tags that are incorrectly closed in an HTML document.

Selector syntax depends on the test subject type. When the input data is an HTML document or set of elements, the selector must be a CSS selector. When a formal selector syntax is not available for the test subject type, the selector may be described unambiguously in plain English.

Test Cases {#test-proc-cases}
---------------------------------------

Each rule contains one or more test cases written in plain language. Each test case MUST provide the following:

* Test case mode identifying whether test case steps are automated, semi-automated or require manual testing.
* Test case steps which clearly outline the steps necessary to reach the result.
* Test case result indicating whether test case passed or failed.
  * Description of the error causing any failing result.

Test case results are combined with other test case results to provide a cumulative outcome, pass or fail, of the rule. When a rule has multiple test cases, the results of all test cases are combined to give a single result for each selected item. The results are cumulative, meaning that as long as one test case passes, the rule has passed.

Example:
A rule for HTML img elements has two test cases, one that checks if there is a text alternative, and another that checks if the image is marked as decorative. If either one of these passed, the rule has passed. Only if both fail, does that element fail the rule.


ACT Output Data {#output}
=========================

With ACT Rules, it becomes important that data coming from different sources can be compared. Only by having a shared vocabulary, can accessibility data that is produced by different auditors be compared and where necessary aggregated. Every ACT Rule MUST therefore require that the output is expressed in a format that has all of the features described in the ACT Data Format.

ACT Data Format {#output-format}
--------------------------------

Rules are tested in two steps. Firstly, the selector is applied to the web page or other test subject. This results in a list of *Selected item* (elements, tags or other 'components') to test. Following this, each *selected item* will be taken through the test procedure of the rule. This will give the *outcome* for each *selected item*. For contextual information, the output data must also include *test subject* and the *rule identifier*.

This will mean that every time a rule is executed on a page, it will return a set with zero or more results, each of which has at least the following properties:

- test (Rule ID)
- subject (Web page)
- pointer (Selected item)
- outcome (`passed`, `failed` or `cantTell`)

### Example: (using EARL and JSON-LD)

```javascript
{
  "@context": "<see appendix 1>",
  "@type": "Assertion",
  "subject": "https://example.org/",
  "test": "auto-wcag:rules/SC1-1-1-css-image.html",
  "outcome": "Failed",
  "pointer": "html > body > h1:first-child"
}
```

### Selected Item

When representing the selected item in the output data, it is often impractical or impossible to serialize the selected item as a whole. Instead of this, a pointer can be used to indicate where the selected item exists within the web page or other test subject. There are a variety of pointer methods available, such as those defined in [Pointer Methods in RDF 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/Pointers-in-RDF/).

The pointer method used in the output data of an ACT Rule MUST include the pointer method used [Implementation Test Cases](#quality-implement).

### Outcome

The procedure of a rule MUST always return one of the following outcomes:

- `passed`: The Test Target passed the test
- `failed`: The Test Target failed the test
- `cantTell`: It is unclear whether or not the Test Target passes of rails the test

### Ensure Comparable Results

In addition to the Selected Item and the Outcome, ACT Rules MUST require contextual information be provided. This must include what web page, file or other test subject the rule was applied to, as well as an identifier of the rule itself.

### Test Subject

When a single URL can be used to reference the web page, or other test subject, this URL MUST be used. In scenarios where more complex actions are required to obtain the test subject (in the state that it is to be tested), it is left to ATT developers to determine which method is best used to express the test subject.

Rule Aggregation {#output-aggregation}
--------------------------------------

As describe in section [ACT Data Format](#output-format) a rule will return a list of results, each of which contain 1) an outcome (passed, failed or cantTell), 2) the selected item, 3) the Rule ID and 4) the test subject. We can create a new result, that combines all the results of that rule, to create provide a single result for that rule.

Individual cases are useful for remediation, but often what is needed is a higher level view of accessibility. For instance, when reporting accessibility to higher management, all they are interested in is which websites aren't meeting the requirements.

An aggregated result takes puts the original data as it's source data. Aggregated results do not have a pointer. The outcome of the aggregated result, is the worst outcome on the source data. (E.g. If there is one Failed, and ten Passed, the aggregated outcome is Failed)

Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": "<see appendix 1>",
  "@type": "Assertion",
  "subject": "https://example.org/",
  "test": "auto-wcag:rules/SC1-1-1-css-image.html",
  "outcome": "Failed",
  "sourceData": [{
    "outcome": "Failed",
    "pointer": "html > body > h1:first-child"
  }, {
    "outcome": "Passed",
    "pointer": "html > body > h1:nth-child(2)"
  }]
}
```

Data that is common to all sourceData items can be removed if it is put on the aggregate, like in the example, subject and test are already part of the aggregate, so those values are removed from sourceData items.

Results can be aggregated much further than the rule level. A rule is a partial test for WCAG Success Criterion or other accessibility requirement. In the same way a list of results from a rule are aggergated to a single result for that rule, results of rules that test a specific accessibility requirement can be aggregated in a similar way. This can even include results produced by different accessibility test tools (or even those obtained through expert evaluation)

Example: Aggregate rules to a WCAG success criterion

```javascript
{
  "@context": "<see appendix 1>",
  "@type": "Assertion",
  "subject": "https://example.org/",
  "test": {
    "@id": "wcag20:#text-equiv-all",
    "title": "1.1.1 Non-text Content"
  },
  "outcome": "Failed",
  "sourceData": [{
    "outcome": "Failed",
    "test": "auto-wcag:rules/SC1-1-1-css-image.html",
    "pointer": "html > body > h1:first-child"
  }, {
    "outcome": "Passed",
    "test": "auto-wcag:rules/SC1-1-1-longdesc.html",
    "pointer": "html > body > img:nth-child(2)"
  }]
}
```

Example: Aggregate a list of results to a result for the website

```javascript
{
  "@context": "<see below>",
  "@type": "Assertion",
  "subject": {
    "@type": "WebSite",
    "@value": "https://example.org/"
  }
  "test": "http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2A-Conformance",
  "outcome": "Failed",
  "sourceData": [{
    "outcome": "Failed",
    "test": "wcag20:#text-equiv-all",
    "sourceData": [ … ]
  }, {
    "outcome": "Passed",
    "test": "wcag20:#media-equiv-av-only-alt",
    "sourceData": [ … ]
  }, {
    "outcome": "Inapplicable",
    "test": "wcag20:#media-equiv-captions",
    "sourceData": [ … ]
  }, … ]
}
```

Rule Quality Assurance {#quality}
=================================

Managing Exceptions {#quality-exceptions}
-----------------------------------------

Editor note: This section will describe how a rule author should document scenarios where a rule might cause incorrect results. Such exceptions exist in nearly every rule and must be managed actively. Some exceptions can be mitigated by adjusting the rule, but others may be unavoidable. In both cases documenting such exceptions is valuable in interpreting the results of a rule.


Implementation Validation {#quality-implement}
----------------------------------------------

Editor note: This section describes the requirements of tests that have to be created for a rule. Rules are abstract, high level descriptions. To ensure the implementation of rules is done correctly, validation tests have to be provided along with each rule.


Accuracy Benchmarking {#quality-accuracy}
-----------------------------------------

Editor note: This section describes how to measure the rate of incorrect results to correct results of a rule. Measuring this accuracy, not just on test data, but on pages and components that the rules would actually be applied to, is important to give users of the test results confidence in the accuracy of this data.


Update Management {#quality-updates}
------------------------------------

### Version Numbers ### {#quality-updates-version}

Each ACT Rule must have it's own version number. The version number has to follow the semantic versioning schema. Using the X.Y.Z schema in the following way:

: X / Major updates:
:: The major version number must be increased if the change can lead to new failure results.

: Y / Minor updates:
:: The minor version number must be increased if the test logic has been updated, which could lead to a a different result.

: Z / Patch updates:
:: The patch version number must be increased if the change does not affect the result of a rule. This includes editorial changes, new issues on the issues list, an updated description, etc.

### Change List ### {#quality-updates-changes}

All major and minor changes to an ACT Rule must be recorded in a change log, that is part of the updated rule. The change log must at least include the changes since the last minor update, as well as a reference to the previous version.

### Issues List ### {#quality-updates-issues}

An ACT Rule may include an issues list. This list must be used to record cases in which the ACT Rule might return a failure where it should have returned a pass or vice versa. There may be several reasons why this might occur, including:

- Certain scenarios or the use of technologies is very rare and was not included in the rule for that reason.
- Certain accessibility features are impossible to test within the test environment. They might for instance only be testable by accessing the accessibility API, require screen capturing, etc.
- The scenario did not exist (due to changing technologies) or was overlooked during the initial design of the rule.

The issues list serves two purposes. For users of ACT Rules, they give insight into why an inaccurate result might have occurred, as well as provide confidence in the result of that rule. For the designer of the rule, the issues list is also useful to plan future updates to the rule. A new version of the rule might see issues resolved and the item moved to the change log.
