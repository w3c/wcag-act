Abstract: The Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0 defines a format for writing accessibility test rules. These rules can be carried out fully-automatically, semi-automatically, and manually. This common format allows any party involved in accessibility testing to document and share their testing procedures in a robust and understandable manner. This enables transparency and harmonization of testing methods, including methods implemented by accessibility test tools.

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

There are currently many test procedures and tools available which aid their users in testing web content for conformance to accessibility standards such as the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) [[WCAG]]. As the web develops in both size and complexity, these procedures and tools are essential for managing the accessibility of resources available on the web.

This format is intended to enable a consistent interpretation of how to test conformance to [=accessibility requirements documents=] and promote consistent results of accessibility tests. It is intended to be used to describe both manual accessibility tests as well as automated tests performed by accessibility testing tools.

Describing how to test certain accessibility requirements will result in accessibility tests that are transparent, with test results that are reproducible. The Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format defines the requirements for these test descriptions, known as Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules (ACT Rules).


Scope {#scope}
==============

The ACT Rules Format defined in this specification is focused on the description of rules that can be used in testing content created using web technologies, such as [Hypertext Markup Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/) [[HTML]], [Cascading Style Sheets](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/) [[css-2018]], [Accessible Rich Internet Applications](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) [[WAI-ARIA]], [Scaleable Vector Graphics](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) [[SVG2]] and more, including digital publishing. The ACT Rules Format is designed to be technology agnostic, meaning that it can conceivably be used to describe test rules for other technologies.

The ACT Rules Format can be used to describe ACT Rules dedicated to testing the [=accessibility requirements=] defined in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[WCAG]], which are specifically designed for web content. Other accessibility requirements applicable to web technologies can also be testable with ACT Rules. For example, ACT Rules could be developed to test the conformance of web-based user agents to the [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/) [[UAAG20]]. The ACT Rules Format might not always be suitable to describe tests for other types of accessibility requirements.


ACT Rule Types {#rule-types}
============================

In accessibility, there are often different technical solutions to make the same type of content accessible. Multiple solutions could be tested in a single rule; however, such a rule tends to be quite complex, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The ACT Rules Format solves this by providing two types of rules:

- <dfn>Atomic rules</dfn> describe how to test a specific type of solution. It contains a precise definition of what elements, nodes or other parts of a [=test subject=] are to be tested, and when those elements are considered to fail the rule. These rules are to be kept small and *atomic*. Meaning that atomic rules test a single "failure condition", and do so without using the [=outcome=] of other rules.

- <dfn>Composite rules</dfn> describe how the [=outcomes=] of multiple [=atomic rules=] or composite rules can be combined into a single outcome. A composite rule can have multiple "satisfying conditions", each of these provided in separate atomic or composite rules. The logic in the composite rule describes how any one of these satisfying conditions, or some combination of them is used to determine a single outcome.

<div class="example">
  <p>Composite rule: Header cells in HTML tables (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships" target="_blank">WCAG 2 Success Criterion 1.3.1</a>).</p>
  <p>This rule uses outcomes from the following rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Header indicated through implicit scope</li>
    <li>Header indicated through the `scope` attribute</li>
    <li>Header indicated by using the `headers` attribute</li>
    <li>Header indicated by using ARIA labels</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If any one of these rules passes, the outcome of the composite rule for the table cell is "passed".</p>
</div>

The separation between atomic rules and composite rules can be seen as a division of responsibility. Atomic rules typically test if web content is correctly implemented in a particular solution. Composite rules can test if a combination of outcomes from other rules satisfy the accessibility requirement, in part or as a whole.

Not all atomic rules have to be part of a composite rule. Composite rules are used when the outcomes of multiple rules need to be combined in order to determine (non-)conformance of a test subject to an [=accessibility requirement=].


ACT Rule Structure {#act-rule-structure}
===============================

An ACT Rule MUST consist of at least the following items:

* Descriptive Title
* [Rule Identifier](#rule-identifier)
* [Rule Description](#rule-description)
* [Rule type](#rule-types)
* [Accessibility Requirements Mapping](#accessibility-requirements-mapping)
* [Aspects Under Test](#input-aspects) (for atomic rules) OR [Input Rules List](#input-rules-list) (for composite rules)
* [Applicability](#applicability)
* [Expectations](#expectations)
* [Assumptions](#assumptions)
* [Accessibility Support](#accessibility-support)
* [Test Cases](#test-cases)
* [Change Log](#change-log)
* [Issues List](#issues-list)
* [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) (optional)
* [Background](#background) (optional)
* ACT Rules Format [=outcome=] definition

ACT Rules MUST be written in a format that conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[WCAG]] or a comparable accessibility standard. ACT Rule [test cases](#test-cases) are allowed to contain inaccessible content. If any test case contains accessibility issues listed in [WCAG 2.1 Section 5.2.5 Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc5), users MUST be warned of this in advance. Using an accessible format supports people with disabilities. It also makes internationalization of ACT Rules easier.


Rule Identifier {#rule-identifier}
==================================

An ACT Rule MUST have a unique identifier that can be any unique text, such as plain text, URL or a database identifier.

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: ACT Rules may use file names as identifiers. They include a technology directory, followed by a handle that includes an element name or attribute:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>html+svg/video-alternative</li>
    <li>html+svg/meta-no-refresh</li>
    <li>html+svg/unique-id</li>
  </ul>
</div>


Rule Description {#rule-description}
=========================================

An ACT Rule MUST have a description that is in plain language, and provides a brief explanation of what the rule does.

<div class=example>
  **Example**: This rule checks that the HTML page has a title
</div>

<div class=example>
  **Example**: The rule checks that for the `html` element, there is no mismatch between the primary language in non-empty `lang` and `xml:lang` attributes, if both are used.
</div>


Accessibility Requirements Mapping {#accessibility-requirements-mapping}
========================================================

When an ACT Rule is designed to test the conformance to one or more [=Accessibility requirements documents=], the rule MUST list all [=accessibility requirements=] from those documents that are not satisfied when the outcome of the rule is `failed`. For example, when designing a rule for WCAG 2.1 that tests if image buttons have an alternative text, the rule maps to success criteria 1.1.1 Non-text content, and 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.

Each [=accessibility requirement=] in the mapping MUST include the following:

1. the name, title or summary of the accessibility requirement, and
2. the name of the [=accessibility requirements document=], and
3. a link to the [=accessibility requirements document=] if one exists, and
4. the conformance level associated with the accessibility requirement, if one exists.

For each accessibility requirement in the mapping, an ACT Rule MUST indicate what the [=outcome=] of the rule means for satisfying that accessibility requirement. When the outcome is `failed`, the accessibility requirements are *<dfn>not satisfied</dfn>*. When the outcome is `passed` or `inapplicable`, the accessibility requirements could be *<dfn>satisfied</dfn>*, or *<dfn>further testing could be necessary</dfn>*. Rules that can be used to determine if an accessibility requirement is *satisfied* are called <dfn>satisfying tests</dfn>.

<div class=note>
**Note**: In WCAG 2.1, success criteria do not evaluate to `passed`, `failed` or `inapplicable`. Rather they can be *satisfied* (or not). (See the [WCAG 2.1 definition: satisfies a success criterion](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-satisfies).) If a success criterion is *not satisfied* a web page can only conform if there is a conforming alternative version, as described in [WCAG 2.1 Conformance Requirement 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc1).
</div>

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Accessibility Requirements Mapping for a rule that tests if an image button has an accessible name:
  <blockquote><ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content">
        Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text content
      </a><ul>
        <li><strong>Required for conformance</strong> to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 level A</li>
        <li>Outcome mapping: <ul>
          <li>Failed outcome: not satisfied</li>
          <li>Passed outcome: further testing is needed</li>
          <li>Inapplicable outcome: further testing is needed</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value">
        Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value
      </a><ul>
        <li><strong>Required for conformance</strong> to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 level A</li>
        <li>Outcome mapping:<ul>
          <li>Failed outcome: not satisfied</li>
          <li>Passed outcome: further testing is needed</li>
          <li>Inapplicable outcome: further testing is needed</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul></blockquote>
</div>

ACT Rules can be used to test accessibility requirements that are not part of a W3C accessibility standard, such as [[WAI-ARIA]] requirements, or a testing methodology like [RGAA 3](https://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/criteria.html). An ACT Rule MUST indictate whether or not the [=accessibility requirement=] it maps to is required for conformance in its [=accessibility requirements document=]. Examples of accessibility requirements that are not required for conformance are WCAG sufficient techniques, or a company style guide which includes both requirements and optional "best practices". That distinction between what is required and what is optional has to be made clear.

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong>Accessibility Requirements Mapping for a rule that tests that each `img` element has an `alt` attribute</p>
  <blockquote><ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H37.html">
      Technique H37: Using alt attributes on img elements
      </a><ul>
        <li><strong>Not required</strong> for conformance to WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 at any level</li>
        <li>Outcome mapping: <ul>
          <li>Failed outcome: not satisfied</li>
          <li>Passed outcome: satisfied</li>
          <li>Inapplicable outcome: satisfied</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://disic.github.io/rgaa_referentiel_en/criteria.html#test-1-1-1">
      RGAA 3, Test 1.1.1: Does each image have a text alternative
      </a><ul>
        <li><strong>Required for conformance</strong> to RGAA 3 level A</li>
        <li>Outcome mapping: <ul>
          <li>Failed outcome: not satisfied</li>
          <li>Passed outcome: satisfied</li>
          <li>Inapplicable outcome: satisfied</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul></blockquote>
</div>

If the `failed` outcome can not be mapped to *not satisfied* for an accessibility requirement, that requirement MUST NOT be included in the accessibility requirements mapping. The optional [Background section](#background) could be used to list accessibility requirements and standards that may be thematically related, but for which the rule is not a failure test.

If the rule does not map to any [=accessibility requirement=], the accessibility requirement mapping will only contain the explainer that it is not required for conformance to the [=accessibility requirements document=]. This is common with atomic rules used in composite rules, where accessibility requirements are only not satisfied with multiple atomic rules have the outcome`failed`.

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> An ACT Rule that tests a best practice not included in any accessibility standard:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This rule is <strong>not required</strong> for conformance to WCAG 2.0 or WCAG 2.1 at any level.</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

<div class=note>
**Note**: While rules are often designed for one, or possibly a small collection of [=accessibility requirements document=], it is likely that other accessibility requirements documents also map to those rules. For example, rules may be written for WCAG 2.1, but many of those may map to a company's internal accessibility policy. In such a scenario, an external accessibility requirements mapping could be created. An external accessibility requirements mapping ammend the accessibility requirements mapping of a rule by adding mapping to a different accessibility requirements document. An external accessibility requirements mapping avoids duplication of a rule, for the sole purpose of changing the mapping.
</div>


Aspects Under Test (Atomic rules only) {#input-aspects}
=======================================================

An aspect is a distinct part of the [=test subject=]. For example, rendering a particular piece of content to an end user involves multiple different technologies, some or all of which can be of use in an [atomic rule]. Some rules need to operate directly on the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) [[http11]] messages exchanged between a server and a client, while others need to operate on the [Document Object Model](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org) [[DOM]] tree exposed by a web browser. Rules can operate on several aspects simultaneously, such as both the HTTP messages and the DOM tree.

[=Atomic rules=] MUST list the aspects used in the [applicability](#applicability-atomic) and [expectations](#expectations-atomic).

Some aspects are already well defined in a formal specification within the context of web content, such as HTTP messages, DOM tree, and CSS styling [[css-2018]]. These do not warrant a detailed description further than a reference to the corresponding section in this specification (see [Common Aspects under Test](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/NOTE-act-rules-common-aspects.html)).

For other aspects that are not well defined, an ACT Rule MUST include either a detailed description of the aspect in question or a reference to a well defined description.

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: Test aspects for a rule that checks if images have an accessible name:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DOM Tree</li>
    <li>CSS Styling</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: Test aspects for a rule that checks if a transcript is available for videos:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DOM Tree</li>
    <li>CSS Styling</li>
    <li>Audio output</li>
    <li>Visual output</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: Test aspects for a rule that checks for use of (language specific) generic link texts like "click here" and "more":</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DOM Tree</li>
    <li>CSS Styling</li>
    <li>Language</li>
  </ul>
</div>


Input Rules List (Composite rules only) {#input-rules-list}
==========================================================

A [=composite rule=] uses [=outcomes=] from [=atomic rules=] or other composite rules and applies a logic to them so that a single outcome can be determined for each [=test target=]. The identifiers of all rules used in the [expectations](#expectations-composite) MUST be listed in the composite rule. The rules list describes the input for composite rules, similar to how [aspects under test](#input-aspects) describe the input for atomic rules.


Applicability {#applicability}
==============================

The applicability describes what (parts of) the [=test subject=] are tested.


Applicability for Atomic Rules {#applicability-atomic}
------------------------------------------------------

The applicability section is a required part of an [=atomic rule=]. It MUST contain a precise description of the parts of the [=test subject=] to which the rule applies. For example, specific nodes in the DOM [[DOM]] tree, or tags that are incorrectly closed in an HTML [[HTML]] document. These are known as the [=test targets=]. The applicability MUST only use information provided through [test aspects](#input-aspects) of the same rule. No other information can be used in the applicability.

Applicability MUST be described objectively, unambiguously and in plain language.

An objective description is one that can be resolved without uncertainty, in a given technology. Examples of objective properties in HTML are element names, their computed role, the spacing between two elements, etc. Subjective properties on the other hand, are concepts like decorative, navigation mechanism and pre-recorded. Even concepts like headings and images can be misunderstood. For example, describing that the rule examines the tag name, the accessibility role, or the element's purpose on the web page. The latter of which is almost impossible to define objectively. When used in applicability, potentially ambiguous concepts MUST be defined objectively. This definition can be part of a larger glossary shared between rules.

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: The applicability of an atomic rule testing <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#audio-control" target="_blank">WCAG 2.1 Audio Control:</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Any <code>video</code> or <code>audio</code> element(s) with the <code>autoplay</code> attribute, as well as any <code>object</code> element(s) that is used for automatically playing video or audio when the web page loads.</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>


Applicability for Composite Rules {#applicability-composite}
----------------------------------------------------------

A [=composite rule=] defines how the [=outcomes=] from rules in its [input rules list](#input-rules-list) are used to determine a single outcome.

The applicability of a composite rule is defined as the union of all the applicability sections of its [=atomic rules=] as well as atomic rules that make up any composite rules in the [input rules list](#input-rules-list). Rule authors MAY describe the applicability for composite rules. This can be useful if it is difficult to express the combined applicability in plain language. If the composite rule includes applicability, it MUST be the union of all the applicability sections of the atomic rules.

Note that atomic rules in a composite rule MAY have different applicability. Because of this, not every element applicable within the composite rule is tested by every atomic rule.

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: A composite rule about `img` elements uses results from atomic rules that have the following applicability:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Atomic rule1</strong>: All `img` element with an `alt` attribute</li>
    <li><strong>Atomic rule1</strong>: All `img` element without an `alt` attribute</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The applicability of the composite rule combines the applicability of both atomic rules. This becomes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>All `img` elements.</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>


Expectations {#expectations}
==============================

The expectations describe what the requirements are for the [=test targets=] derived from the [applicability](#applicability).


Expectations for Atomic Rules {#expectations-atomic}
----------------------------------------------------

An [=atomic rule=] MUST contain one or more expectations. An expectation is an assertion that is true about each [=test target=] (see [Applicability](#applicability)). Each expectation MUST be distinct, unambiguous, and be written in plain language. Unlike in applicability, a certain level of subjectivity is allowed in expectations. Meaning that the expectation has only one possible meaning, but that meaning MAY not fully quantifiable.

When all expectations are true for a test target, the test target `passed` the rule. If one or more expectations are false, the test target `failed` the rule. When atomic rules are used in composite rules, the outcome of the composite rules can be `passed` even if the outcome of one of its constituent atomic rule is `failed`, depending on the [expectations](#expectations-composite) of the composite rule.

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: A rule for labels of HTML `input` elements might have the following expectations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The test target has an accessible name (as described in [Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/#mapping_additional_nd_te)). [[accname-aam-1.1]]</li>
    <li>The accessible name describes the purpose of the test target.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

An atomic rule expectation MUST only use information available in the [test aspects](#input-aspects), from the applicability, and other expectations of the same rule. No other information can be used in the expectation. So for instance, an expectation could be "Expectation 1 is true and ...", but it can't be "Rule XYZ passed and ...". This ensures the rule is encapsulated.


Expectations for Composite Rules {#expectations-composite}
--------------------------------------------------------

A [=composite rule=] MUST contain one or more expectations that describes the logic that is used to determine a single `passed` or `failed` [=outcome=] for each [=test target=], based on the outcomes of [=atomic rules=] or [=composite rules=] listed in its [input rules list](#input-rules-list).

When all expectations are true for a test target, the test target `passed` the rule. If one or more expectations is false, the test target `failed` the rule. This works the same way for atomic rules. A composite rule expectation MUST NOT use information from [test aspects](#input-aspects).

<div class="example">
  <p>A composite rule for <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded" target="_blank">WCAG 2.1 Audio Description or Media Alternative</a> applies a logic across results from three atomic rules. The expectation of the composite rule is as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>For each test target, the outcome of one of the following rules is `passed`:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Video elements have an audio description (video-audio-desc)</li>
      <li>Video elements have a media alternative (video-text-alt)</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</div>


Assumptions {#assumptions}
==========================

An ACT Rule MUST list any assumptions, limitations or any exceptions for the evaluation, the test environment, technologies being used or the subject being tested. For example, a rule that would partially test <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a> based on the inspection of CSS properties could state that it is only applicable to HTML text content stylable with CSS, and that the rule does not support images of text.

Sometimes there are multiple plausible ways that an accessibility requirement can be interpreted. For instance, it is not immediately obvious if emoji characters are "text" or "non-text content" under WCAG 2.1. Whatever the interpretation is, this MUST be documented in the rule.

While this item MUST be included in the ACT Rule, it MAY be empty when there are no known assumptions, limitations or exceptions.

Accessibility Support {#accessibility-support}
==============================================
Content can be designed to rely on the support for particular accessibility features by different assistive technologies and user agents. For example, content using a particular WAI-ARIA [[WAI-ARIA]] feature relies on that feature to be supported by assistive technologies and user agents. This content would not work for assistive technologies and user agents that do not support WAI-ARIA. WCAG [[WCAG]] provides a definition for [accessibility supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#accessibility-supporteddef) use of a Web technology.
 
An ACT Rule MUST include known limitations on accessibility support. For example, an atomic rule that checks for a particular accessibility feature that is known not to be widely supported by assistive technologies and web browsers, or a composite rule that lists rules with known accessibility support limitations.

While this item MUST be included in the ACT Rule, it MAY be empty when there are no known accessibility support issues.
 
<div class=note>
  **Note:** WCAG Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) provides guidance on defining an [accessibility support baseline](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/#step1c) for test scenarios, which can help users of ACT Rules to select the appropriate rules for their own circumstance.
</div>


Test Cases {#test-cases}
========================

Test cases are (snippets of) content that can be used to validate the implementation of ACT Rules. Each rule MUST have one or more test cases for `passed`, `failed`, and `inapplicable` [=outcome=]. A test case consists of two pieces of data, a snippet of each [test aspect](#input-aspects) for a rule, and the expected result from evaluating that rule. Test cases serve two functions, firstly as example scenarios for readers to understand when a rule passes, when it fails, and when it is inapplicable. It also serves developers and users of accessibility testing tools and methodologies to validate that a rule is correctly implemented.


Change Log {#change-log}
========================

It is important to keep track of changes to the ACT Rules so that users of the rules can understand if changes in test results are due to changes in the rules used when performing the tests, or from changes in the content itself. All changes to an ACT Rule that can change the [=outcome=] of a evaluation MUST be recorded in a change log. The change log can either be part of the rule document itself or be referenced from it.

Each new release of an ACT Rule MUST be identifiable with either a date or a version number. Additionally, a reference to the previous version of that rule MUST be available. For extensive changes, a new rule SHOULD be created and the old rule SHOULD be deprecated.

<div class=example>
  **Example**: An example of when a new rule ought to be created is when a rule that tests for the use of a `blink` element changes to instead look for any animated style changes. This potentially adds several new failures that were previously out of scope. Using that same rule as an example, adding an exception to allow `blink` elements positioned off screen can be done by updating the existing rule.
</div>


Issues List (optional) {#issues-list}
=====================================

An ACT Rule MAY include a list or a reference to a list of any known issues. The issues list would be used to record cases where the [=outcome=] of an ACT Rule was `failed` where it ought to have been `passed` or `inapplicable`, or vice versa. There are several reasons why this might occur, including:

- Certain scenarios or the use of technologies that are very rare and were not included in the rule for that reason.
- Certain accessibility features are impossible to test within the test environment. For instance, they might only be testable by accessing the accessibility API, require screen capturing, etc.
- The scenario did not exist (due to changing technologies) or was overlooked during the initial design of the rule.

The issues list serves two purposes. For users of ACT Rules, the issues list gives insight into why an inaccurate result occurred, as well as provide confidence in the result of that rule. For the designer of the rule, the issues list is also useful to plan future updates to the rule. In a new version of the rule, resolved issues would be moved to the change log.

Acknowledgements (optional) {#acknowledgements}
===============================================

An ACT Rule MAY contain acknowledgements. This can include, but is not limited to:
* List of rule authors
* List of rule reviewers/contributors
* Funding or other support


Background (optional) {#background}
===================================

An ACT Rule MAY contain information about the background for the development of the rule, or references to relevant reading. The relationship to the relevant reading should be specified. Examples of relevant background references for a rule for a WCAG [[WCAG]] success criterion could be [Understanding documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/), [WCAG Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/), or WAI-ARIA [[WAI-ARIA]], CSS [[css-2018]], or HTML [[HTML]] specifications.


Rule Accuracy {#accuracy}
=========================

This section is *non-normative*.

While [test cases](#test-cases) can be used to determine if an ACT Rule was correctly implemented, they do not guarantee that implementations will never produce incorrect results. When writing ACT Rules, it is almost inevitable that edge cases will be overlooked. Technologies are always evolving, and content authors are constantly coming up with new and unexpected ways to use those.

There are two types of inaccuracies that can produce incorrect results. Inaccuracies in the **implementation** can be addressed with test cases, but inaccuracies in the **ACT Rule** itself can not. After all, rule inaccuracies come from the rule author being unaware of a particular edge case.

When a test result incorrectly indicates non-conformance to an accessibility requirement, this is known as a false positive. Opposite, when a rule incorrectly indicates conformance, this is a false negative. A percentage of false positives and false negatives can be calculated by comparing it to results from an accessibility audit:

- **False positives**: This is the percentage of [=test subjects=], that were `failed` by the rule, but conform to the [=accessibility requirements=].

- **False negatives**: This is the percentage of [=test subjects=], that were `passed` by the rule, but were non-conformant to the [=accessibility requirements=].

The possibility of false positives and false negatives with ACT Rules mean they will likely require ongoing maintainence. Designing a process for maintaining ACT Rules is outside the scope of the ACT Rules Format, which is limited to the rules themselves. Neverthless, it is suggested that rule authors work out a process for maintaining their rules.


Harmonization {#harmonization}
==============================

This section is *non-normative*.

While the ACT Rules Format is designed to stimulate harmonization, there are no direct requirement in the ACT Rules Format that prevent a rule author from writing rules inconsistent with already established ACT Rules. Neither are there requirements for ACT Rules to have a certain number of implementations, or to have a certain level of accuracy. This allows quality requirements to be different for different user groups, and allows them to develop over time.

Harmonization occurs when a group of rule implementors collectively accept the validity of an ACT Rule. For example, a community group of accessibility testing tool vendors could declare they've harmonized on a particular set of ACT Rules. Such a group can set acceptance criteria for rules, and have quality requirements that go beyond the ACT Rules Format. For example:

<div class=example>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>: The ACT EPUB group might have the following acceptance criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An ACT EPUB Rule is harmonized when it is approved by members of 3 organizations, AND</li>
    <li>An ACT EPUB Rule is harmonized when it has 2 independent implementations</li>
  </ul>
</div>

An example of such a process is the [WCAG ACT Review Process](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act-rules/review-process.html).


Definitions {#definitions}
==========================

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>Accessibility requirement</dfn><dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A requirement is a condition that has to be satisfied in order to conform to a standard, or to comply with a contract, policy or regulation. An accessibility requirement is a requirement aimed at improving access for people with disabilities to an ICT product.</p>
    <p>A common example of accessibility requirements are the WCAG 2.1 success criteria. There are other standards, including W3C standards that include recommendations for accessibility, such as WAI-ARIA and HTML. Accessibility requirements are also often found in company policies, regional standards or in legislation.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>Accessibility requirements document</dfn><dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A document, such as a standard, contract, policy or regulation, that includes [=accessibility requiremenst=]. For example, WCAG 2.1, WAI-ARIA 1.1, HTML 5.2, BBC HTML Accessibility Standards v2.0</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>Test Subject</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A resource or collection of resources that can be evaluated by an ACT Rule.</p>
    <div class=example>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>An HTML page, including all embedded scripts, style and images</li>
        <li>An EPUB document</li>
        <li>A Vue component file</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class=note>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Implementers using the [[EARL10-Schema]] can express the test subject with the [subject property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#subject)</p>
    </div>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>Test Target</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A distinct part of the [=test subject=].</p>
    <div class=example>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nodes within an HTML page</li>
        <li>A period of time within a video</li>
        <li>A range of characters within a text document</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class=note>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Implementers using the [[EARL10-Schema]] can express the test target with the [pointer property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#pointer)</p>
    </div>
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>Outcome</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>One of three types of conclusions that come from evaluating an ACT Rule on a [=test subject=]. An outcome can be:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Inapplicable**: No part of the test subject matches the applicability</li>
      <li>**Passed**: The test subject meets all expectations</li>
      <li>**Failed**: The test subject does not meet all expectations</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: While *inapplicable* is a valid outcome for ACT Rules, it might not be a valid result for all [=accessibility requirements=]. Notably the success criteria of WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 can only be evaluated to satisfied (passed and inapplicable) or not satisfied (failed).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Implementers using the [[EARL10-Schema]] can express the outcome with the [outcome property](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/#outcome). In addition to `passed` `failed` and `inapplicable`, EARL 1.0 also defined an `incomplete` outcome. While this can not be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually. Such "interim" results can be expressed with the `incomplete` outcome.

Appendix 1: Expressing ACT Rule results with JSON-LD and EARL {#appendix-data-example}
=================================================================================

This section is *non-normative*.

**Example:** Output data using EARL and JSON-LD. (See [Evaluation and Report Language](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/earl/) [[EARL10-Schema]] and [Java Script Object Notation (JSON)](https://www.json.org).)

```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wcag-act/master/earl-act.json",
  "@type": "Assertion",
  "subject": "https://example.org/",
  "test": "auto-wcag:rules/SC1-1-1-css-image.html",
  "result": {
    "outcome": "earl:failed",
    "pointer": "html > body > h1:first-child"
  }
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wcag-act/master/earl-act.json",
  "@type": "Assertion",
  "subject": "https://example.org/",
  "test": "auto-wcag:SC1-1-1-css-image.html",

  "result": {
    "outcome": "Failed",
    "source": [{
      "test": "auto-wcag:SC1-1-1-css-image.html",
      "result": {
        "outcome": "Failed",
        "pointer": "html > body > h1:first-child"
      }
    }, {
      "test": "auto-wcag:SC1-1-1-longdesc.html",
      "result": {
        "outcome": "Passed",
        "pointer": "html > body > img:nth-child(2)"
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

**Example:** Aggregate a list of results to a result for the website

```javascript
{
  "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wcag-act/master/earl-act.json",
  "@type": "Assertion",
  "subject": {
    "@type": ["WebSite", "TestSubject"],
    "@value": "https://example.org/"
  }
  "test": "http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2A-Conformance",
  "result": {
    "outcome": "Failed",
    "source": [{
      "test": "wcag20:text-equiv-all",
      "result": {
        "outcome": "Failed",
        "source": [ … ]
      }
    }, {
      "test": "wcag20:media-equiv-av-only-alt",
      "result": {
        "outcome": "Passed",
        "source": [ … ]
      }
    }, {
      "test": "wcag20:media-equiv-captions",
